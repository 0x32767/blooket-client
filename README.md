# Blooket Client

## Word of Caution!

I do not encourage the use of this program! To all [skids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie) I was not caught using this program, but I can't grantee the same for you. In the best case, you will be punished in school, worst case, the school could could contact law enforcement (under the assumption that you have genuinely hacked blooket). If you don't know how this program works then you shouldn't be using it.

## Bit of Background

I made this program during my [skid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie) phase, it is a program that I used to win blooket games in class. I unfortunately have forgotten how this program works (as it was written over 3 years ago), and unlike my [Lexia-Power-Up-Answer-Giver](https://github.com/0x32767/Lexia-powerup-answer-giver), this one was never documented. I leave this repo open incase I need make reference to it for my uni application.
